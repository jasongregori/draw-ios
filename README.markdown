draw-ios
========

You can draw images using code with this iOS project.
Just change the code in `DrawMeView`. You can use `drawRect:` or add subviews.
When you run on the simulator, you can see the view and hit save to save it to your desktop.


TODO

1. Use a scrollview so you can zoomin on what you draw
2. Take shadow into account when saving images
